## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### From the Analysis

**Priority 1:** Start with TS19
- Complete documentation in repo
- Just needs manuscript formatting
- Clear path to publication

**Priority 2:** Then do ACF
- You're already familiar
- Clinical relevance high
- Quick to complete once organized

**Priority 3:** Get clarity from Dr. Nelson
- Confirm priorities
- Clarify authorship
- Set realistic timeline
