# QUICK START GUIDE - What to Do Right Now

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for immediate action

---

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING

**The ACF project files are NOT in this GitHub repository!**

Only your recent analysis scripts are here. The original ACF data, manuscript, and results are on your local PC (from the ZIP file).

---

## üéØ THREE PATHS FORWARD

### PATH 1: Focus on TS19 (Recommended - Easiest)

**Why:** Complete documentation already in this repo (Bo's thesis)

**What to do TODAY:**

1. **Open Bo's thesis** (it's in this repo!)
   ```
   File: Thesis/Bo Thesis final.docx
   Read: Chapter 1 (TS19 project)
   Time: 2-3 hours
   ```

2. **Review manuscript outline**
   ```
   File: TS19 paper/TS19 Cell Typing Outline Doc v1.0.docx
   Time: 30 minutes
   ```

3. **Check methods**
   ```
   File: TS19 paper/Material and Methods v1.2 Bo.docx
   Time: 30 minutes
   ```

4. **Assess publication readiness**
   - Is thesis chapter sufficient?
   - What needs to be added?
   - Can we access raw data?

**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks to publication

---

### PATH 2: Focus on ACF (Your Current Work)

**Why:** You've already started, clinical relevance

**What to do TODAY:**

1. **Locate ACF files on your PC**
   - Find the ZIP file contents
   - Find: "Copy of Oncomine manuscript BL dwr2 5-11.docx"
   - Find: Normalized data files
   - Find: DE and GSEA results

2. **Add ACF files to GitHub**
   ```bash
   # On your Windows PC:
   cd C:\work\BO_S
   
   # Create directories
   mkdir manuscripts\acf_paper\drafts
   mkdir data\processed\acf\normalized
   mkdir data\processed\acf\dge
   mkdir data\processed\acf\gsea
   
   # Copy files (adjust paths as needed)
   copy "path\to\manuscript.docx" manuscripts\acf_paper\drafts\
   copy "path\to\ACF normalized epi.csv" data\processed\acf\normalized\
   # etc.
   
   # Commit and push
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add ACF project files"
   git push
   ```

3. **Review what you have**
   - Read the manuscript
   - Check data completeness
   - Identify gaps

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to publication

---

### PATH 3: Get Clarity First (Safest)

**Why:** Make informed decision with Dr. Nelson

**What to do TODAY:**

1. **Read the analysis I created**
   ```
   File: PROJECT_STATUS_ANALYSIS.md (in this repo)
   Time: 20 minutes
   ```

2. **Email Dr. Nelson**
   ```
   Subject: Bo's Projects - Need Direction

   Dr. Nelson,

   I've analyzed Bo's GitHub repository and discovered:
   
   1. TS19 project is fully documented in the repo (thesis, 
      manuscript outline, methods)
   
   2. ACF project files are NOT in the repo - only my recent 
      analysis scripts are there
   
   Questions:
   - Which project should I prioritize?
   - For ACF: Where are the original files?
   - For TS19: Can we access the raw data on Ion server?
   
   I've created a detailed analysis (PROJECT_STATUS_ANALYSIS.md 
   in the repo). Can we schedule 30 minutes to discuss?
   
   Best,
   Shan
   ```

3. **Wait for response** (don't start major work until clarity)

**Timeline:** TBD after meeting

## üìä COMPARISON: TS19 vs ACF

| Aspect | TS19 | ACF |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Documentation in Repo** | ‚úÖ Complete (thesis) | ‚ùå Missing |
| **Manuscript** | ‚úÖ Outline exists | ‚ùå Not in repo |
| **Data** | ‚ùì On Ion server | ‚ùå Not in repo |
| **Analysis** | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Your script works |
| **Figures** | ‚úÖ In thesis | ‚úÖ You generated |
| **Time to Publication** | 4-6 weeks | 2-3 weeks (if files found) |
| **Novelty** | High (comprehensive atlas) | High (early cancer detection) |
| **Your Familiarity** | Low (need to learn) | High (already working on it) |

## üîç WHAT'S IN THIS REPO RIGHT NOW

### TS19 Materials (Complete)
- ‚úÖ Bo's complete thesis (80 MB)
- ‚úÖ Manuscript outline
- ‚úÖ Methods documentation
- ‚úÖ Pipeline protocol
- ‚úÖ Results summary (85 entries)

### ACF Materials (Incomplete)
- ‚úÖ Your analysis script (`src/analysis/acf_pubplots.R`)
- ‚úÖ Your generated figures (`results/figures/main/`)
- ‚úÖ Your PCA tables (`results/tables/`)
- ‚ùå Original manuscript
- ‚ùå Original data files
- ‚ùå Original analysis results

### Other
- ‚úÖ PPT and writeups (various projects)
- ‚úÖ Pipeline documentation

## üí° MY RECOMMENDATION

**Start with TS19 because:**

1. **Everything is here** - No need to hunt for files
2. **Bo did the work** - Thesis chapter is essentially done
3. **Clear path** - Thesis ‚Üí Manuscript ‚Üí Publication
4. **Learn from complete example** - See how Bo documented everything

**Then do ACF because:**

1. You're already familiar with it
2. Your analysis pipeline works
3. Clinical relevance is high
4. Can be done quickly once files are organized

## üéØ BOTTOM LINE

**You have TWO projects:**

1. **TS19:** Fully documented in this repo, needs manuscript formatting
2. **ACF:** Files not in repo, needs organization first

**You need to:**

1. **Decide** which to prioritize (or ask Dr. Nelson)
2. **For TS19:** Read the thesis and assess
3. **For ACF:** Find and organize the files
4. **Then:** Follow the appropriate timeline

**I recommend:** Start with TS19 because everything you need is already here.
