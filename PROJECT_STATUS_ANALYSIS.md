## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After thorough analysis of Bo's GitHub repository, thesis, and all available files, here's the critical finding:

**IMPORTANT DISCOVERY:** The GitHub repository contains **TS19 (single-cell mouse embryo) project materials** but **NO ACF project materials**. 

The ACF project files you mentioned (from the ZIP file I analyzed earlier) are **NOT in the GitHub repository**. They exist separately on your local PC.

## PROJECT 2: ACF (Aberrant Crypt Foci) - NOT IN GITHUB ⚠️

### What's Missing from GitHub

The ACF project materials are **NOT in the current GitHub repository**. Based on my earlier analysis of the ZIP file you provided, the ACF project includes:

**Data Files (NOT in GitHub):**
- Normalized counts (epithelial, stromal)
- Sample metadata
- Differential expression results
- GSEA results
- PCA data

**Manuscript (NOT in GitHub):**
- `Copy of Oncomine manuscript BL dwr2 5-11.docx`
- Multiple versions and updates

**Figures (NOT in GitHub):**
- Original PCA plots
- Original heatmaps
- GSEA bar charts
- Multiple PowerPoint files with figures

### What IS in GitHub (Your Recent Work)

✅ `src/analysis/acf_pubplots.R` - Your analysis script
✅ `results/figures/main/20251010_acf_*.pdf` - Your generated figures
✅ `results/tables/20251010_acf_*.csv` - Your PCA scores

### Critical Action Needed

**You need to add ACF project materials to GitHub:**

1. **Manuscript files** → `manuscripts/acf_paper/`
2. **Data files** → `data/processed/acf/` (or keep local, document location)
3. **Original analysis results** → `results/`
4. **Documentation** → `docs/`

### TS19 Pipeline (From Documentation)

**Step-by-Step Process:**

```
1. Raw Data Processing
   FASTQ files
   ↓ Cell Ranger (10X Genomics)
   UMI count matrix

2. Quality Control
   Filter cells: nGene > 200, nUMI > 500
   Filter genes: detected in ≥3 cells
   Remove high mitochondrial % cells

3. Normalization
   Log-normalize by total counts
   Scale and center

4. Dimensionality Reduction
   PCA (50 components)
   t-SNE or UMAP for visualization

5. Clustering
   IBS (Iterative Binary Splitting)
   - Hierarchical clustering approach
   - Splits clusters iteratively
   - Stops when no improvement

6. Cell Type Annotation
   GSEA with multiple databases:
   - Gene Ontology
   - KEGG pathways
   - Cell type markers
   
   Marker gene projection
   Cell lineage map scoring

7. Sub-clustering
   For major cell types:
   - Repeat clustering on subset
   - Identify subtypes
   - Map developmental stages

8. Trajectory Analysis
   Pseudotime calculation
   Developmental paths
   Gene expression dynamics
```

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Organize ACF Project in GitHub

**Action:** Add ACF materials to repository

```bash
# Create proper structure
mkdir -p manuscripts/acf_paper/drafts
mkdir -p manuscripts/acf_paper/figures
mkdir -p data/processed/acf/normalized
mkdir -p data/processed/acf/dge
mkdir -p data/processed/acf/gsea

# Copy files from your PC
# (You'll need to do this from your Windows PC)
```

**What to Add:**
1. Manuscript drafts
2. Analysis results (DE, GSEA)
3. Documentation
4. Original figures

**What to Keep Local:**
- Raw sequencing data (too large)
- Intermediate files (can regenerate)

### Priority 2: Assess TS19 Publication Readiness

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Read Bo's Thesis Chapter 1** (it's in the repo!)
   ```bash
   # Open: Thesis/Bo Thesis final.docx
   # Focus on Chapter 1 (TS19 project)
   ```

2. **Review Manuscript Outline**
   ```bash
   # Open: TS19 paper/TS19 Cell Typing Outline Doc v1.0.docx
   ```

3. **Check Methods Documentation**
   ```bash
   # Open: TS19 paper/Material and Methods v1.2 Bo.docx
   ```

4. **Assess Data Availability**
   - Contact IT about Ion server
   - Check if `/data5/bo/UMI_table/TS19.qc.all.0excluded.csv` exists

### Priority 3: Clarify Project Status with Dr. Nelson

**Questions to Ask:**

1. **ACF Project:**
   - Where are the original ACF files? (Not in GitHub)
   - Should we add them to GitHub?
   - What's the priority for ACF publication?

2. **TS19 Project:**
   - Is the thesis chapter sufficient for publication?
   - Should we expand the manuscript outline?
   - Can we access the raw data?

3. **Overall Strategy:**
   - Which project to prioritize?
   - Timeline expectations?
   - Authorship plans?

## 💡 MY STRONG RECOMMENDATION

### Option A: Start with TS19 (Recommended)

**Why:**
1. **Complete documentation** already in repo (thesis)
2. **All analysis done** - just needs manuscript formatting
3. **Novel contribution** - comprehensive E11.5 atlas
4. **Clear path forward** - thesis → manuscript

**Challenges:**
- Need to locate raw data (Ion server)
- Need to compare with existing atlases
- May need to regenerate some figures

### Option B: Start with ACF

**Why:**
1. You've already started working on it
2. Your analysis scripts are working
3. Clinical relevance may be higher

**Challenges:**
- **Files not in GitHub** - need to organize first
- Need to find original manuscript
- More work needed to complete

### Option C: Parallel Approach

**Week 1-2:** Organize both projects in GitHub
**Week 3-4:** Assess which is closer to completion
**Week 5+:** Focus on the one that's ready

## 🔧 TECHNICAL SETUP NEEDED

### For TS19 Work

**Software:**
- R with Seurat package
- Python with scanpy (optional)
- Cell Ranger (if reprocessing raw data)

**Data Access:**

## 📞 SUMMARY

**What You Have:**
- ✅ Complete TS19 documentation in GitHub (thesis, outlines, methods)
- ✅ Working ACF analysis pipeline (your recent work)
- ❌ ACF project files NOT in GitHub
- ❓ Raw data locations unclear for both projects

**What You Need:**
1. **Clarify with Dr. Nelson:** Which project is priority?
2. **For TS19:** Access raw data, read thesis, assess publication readiness
3. **For ACF:** Locate and organize files, add to GitHub
4. **Then:** Follow the appropriate timeline

**My Recommendation:**
Start with TS19 because the documentation is complete and in the repo. Read Bo's thesis Chapter 1 - it's essentially a complete manuscript that just needs formatting for journal submission.
