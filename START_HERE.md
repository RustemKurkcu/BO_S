## üéØ WHAT YOU NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Read These Documents (30 minutes)

**In this order:**

1. **QUICK_START_GUIDE.md** (5 min)
   - Three paths forward
   - Immediate decisions

2. **PROJECT_STATUS_ANALYSIS.md** (15 min)
   - What Bo did for both projects
   - Current status
   - What's missing

3. **COMPLETE_PROJECT_GUIDE.md** (10 min)
   - Exact scripts to run
   - Detailed explanations
   - Meeting preparation

---

### Step 2: Organize Your Data Files (1 hour)

**You need to copy files from OneDrive to your local repo:**

```powershell
# Open PowerShell
cd C:\work\BO_S

# Create directories if they don't exist
mkdir -p data\processed\acf\normalized
mkdir -p data\processed\acf\dge
mkdir -p data\processed\acf\gsea
mkdir -p data\raw\acf\metadata
mkdir -p manuscripts\acf_paper\drafts

# Now copy files from your OneDrive
# Adjust paths based on where your files actually are

# Example (adjust paths):
# Copy normalized data
copy "path\to\OneDrive\BosFiles\ACF_normalized_epi.csv" data\processed\acf\normalized\

# Copy metadata
copy "path\to\OneDrive\BosFiles\sample_metadata.csv" data\raw\acf\metadata\

# Copy DE results
copy "path\to\OneDrive\BosFiles\DESeq2_output.epi_only.ACF_vs_Norm.xlsx" data\processed\acf\dge\

# Copy GSEA results
copy "path\to\OneDrive\BosFiles\GeneAnalytics_Results*.xlsx" data\processed\acf\gsea\

# Copy manuscript
copy "path\to\OneDrive\BosFiles\Copy of Oncomine manuscript BL dwr2 5-11.docx" manuscripts\acf_paper\drafts\
```

---

### Step 3: Run the Analysis Scripts (2 hours)

**Once files are in place, run these:**

```powershell
cd C:\work\BO_S

# 1. Generate PCA and Heatmaps (Epithelial)
Rscript src/analysis/acf_pubplots.R `
  --counts "data/processed/acf/normalized/ACF_normalized_epi.csv" `
  --meta "data/raw/acf/metadata/sample_metadata.csv" `
  --compartment "Epithelial" `
  --topN 100 `
  --prefix "20251011_acf_epi_final"

# 2. Create GSEA Figure (you'll need to create this script first)
# See COMPLETE_PROJECT_GUIDE.md for the script

# 3. Create Supplementary Figures
# See COMPLETE_PROJECT_GUIDE.md for the script

# 4. Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Add complete ACF analysis and figures"
git push
```

### Step 4: Prepare for Advisor Meeting (1 hour)

**Read and practice:**

1. Open **COMPLETE_PROJECT_GUIDE.md**
2. Go to section: "MEETING WITH ADVISOR GUIDE"
3. Practice explaining:
   - What Bo did
   - What the data shows
   - What you've completed
   - What's left to do

**Key talking points:**
- "Bo studied the earliest precancerous colon lesions using RNA sequencing"
- "He found immune dysfunction begins much earlier than previously thought"
- "I've regenerated all the figures and the manuscript is 90% complete"
- "We can submit in 2 weeks"

---

## üìä THE TWO PROJECTS EXPLAINED SIMPLY

### Project 1: ACF (Almost Done - 90%)

**What:** Study of immune changes in earliest precancerous colon lesions  
**Data:** 20 patients, RNA sequencing, 400 immune genes  
**Finding:** Immune system is already malfunctioning at microscopic stage  
**Impact:** Could lead to early detection blood tests  
**Status:** Manuscript exists, figures need final polish  
**Timeline:** 2 weeks to submission

### Project 2: TS19 (Needs Work - 60%)

**What:** Complete atlas of mouse embryo at critical developmental stage  
**Data:** Thousands of cells, single-cell RNA-seq  
**Finding:** 20 cell types identified, developmental paths mapped  
**Impact:** Reference atlas for developmental biology  
**Status:** Complete thesis chapter, needs manuscript formatting  
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks after ACF

---

## üéì HOW TO EXPLAIN TO YOUR ADVISOR

### For ACF:

**Simple Version:**
"Bo studied the earliest stage of colon cancer development - microscopic abnormalities called ACF. He used RNA sequencing to measure immune gene expression and found that immune dysfunction begins much earlier than we thought. The immune system's GPS is malfunctioning - immune cells can't find the abnormal tissue. Plus, immune cells show signs of exhaustion, similar to advanced cancer. This could lead to early detection tests and even cancer prevention strategies."

**Technical Version:**
"Bo performed RNA-seq on microdissected epithelial and stromal tissue from ACF and matched normal samples from 20 patients. Using DESeq2, he identified 61 differentially expressed genes in epithelium and 36 in stroma. GSEA revealed enrichment of chemokine signaling and immune checkpoint pathways. The findings suggest immune dysfunction is an early enabling event in carcinogenesis, not just a consequence."

### For TS19:

**Simple Version:**
"Bo created a comprehensive single-cell atlas of mouse embryos at E11.5, a critical developmental stage. He identified 20 different cell types and mapped how they develop over time. This provides a reference for understanding normal development, which helps us understand what goes wrong in birth defects and developmental diseases."

**Technical Version:**
"Bo performed 10X Genomics single-cell RNA-seq on E11.5 mouse embryos, analyzing thousands of cells. Using iterative binary splitting clustering and multiple annotation approaches, he identified 20 distinct cell types. Sub-clustering revealed developmental progressions in mesoderm, neuroectoderm, and blood lineages. Trajectory analysis mapped developmental paths and Hox gene expression patterns."
